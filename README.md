# Dataset
Data set used - https://www.kaggle.com/aayushmishra1512/fifa-2021-complete-player-data <br/>

# Goal
The Main goal of this project was to understand the whole distribution of the players in the data that we had and to understand how the potential of players was affected by the growing age in the game. This analysis can further be used for making models that would help in predicting the right players that helps in building an overall valuable team.<br/>

# Approach
1) The very first step was to read our data using the file path followed by checking the head of the data in order to see the columns that we have in our data.
2) The next step was to check for any missing or null values in our data.
3) Visualizing the data and different columns in our data was done next.
4) Tried to get important insights from data by visualizing the columns and also this step would hep in getting the right feature to create our model.
5) Summing up all these and from insights from the analysis we can go on to create our model.

# Scope of Improvement
Graphs using plotly could help a lot in getting deeper insights and building a complete model would ensure completeness of the analysis.
